**Lab 12 Task 2**
---

This program is a modified version of Task 1 and demonstrates how to prevent duplicated data using the appropriate collection.

The text file contains repeated employee names. The program ensures that each employee is stored only once.

---

**Program flow**

1. The program loads a text file containing employee names with repetitions.
2. Data is read line by line using BufferedReader.
3. Each employee is stored in a HashSet, which automatically removes duplicates.
4. The program prints the number of unique employees.
5. All unique employees are displayed.
6. The program checks if a sample employee exists using the `contains()` method.
